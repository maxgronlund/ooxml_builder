# compiled output compared to original document
I have created a project with one slide and unpacked it.
I have build the same document, and unpack that too.


Now I'm comparing the files in the generated out put to the files in the original document


[Content_Types].xml √
_rel
  .rel √
docProps
  app.xml - nothing significant
  core.xml - a timestamp at line 13
